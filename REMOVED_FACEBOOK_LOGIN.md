# Facebook Login Removal - Completed Tasks

## Summary
Successfully removed Facebook login functionality from both frontend and backend of the Draw.io application.

## Changes Made

### Frontend
- ✅ Removed Facebook login button from `apps/draw.io-frontend/components/Auth/Signin.tsx`
- ✅ Removed Facebook login button from `apps/draw.io-frontend/components/Auth/Signup.tsx`

### Backend
- ✅ Removed Facebook OAuth strategy and all related routes from `apps/http-backend/src/index.ts`
- ✅ Removed FacebookStrategy import from backend

### Documentation
- ✅ Updated `OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md` to remove Facebook setup instructions

## Files Modified
1. `apps/draw.io-frontend/components/Auth/Signin.tsx`
2. `apps/draw.io-frontend/components/Auth/Signup.tsx`
3. `apps/http-backend/src/index.ts`
4. `OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

## Notes
- The database schema still contains the `facebookId` field in the User model, but this is harmless as it won't affect functionality
- Environment variables for Facebook can remain as they won't cause issues if unused
- The facebook.svg file was not removed as it might be used elsewhere in the application
- All changes are backward compatible with existing users
